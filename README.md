# Third Eye
### HackSC-2020

## Inspiration
Third eye, AKA the Mind’s Eye or the Inner Eye, is a mystic concept originated from the Dharmic, Taoist, and Christian spiritual tradition. It is said that through spiritual training, even the blinds may obtain vision, or more than vision—a vision through space and time.

The latter part is undoubtedly beyond our knowledge, but we may be able to help the blind regain their vision.

## What it does
Our team integrates computer vision and text-to-speech into one device that can see the world for the blind people and mark it with the sound.

The device has two modes, scanning and searching. In the scanning mode, the Third Eye will take a picture through the camera, and name everything it can tell with words. The generated sound signal will be modified stereophonically, such that the user will be able to recognize the position and distance of the item via sound. In the searching mode, the device will record the user’s voice after a beep sound. The word recorded will determine what the device should be looking for. The searching result will be replied to the user stereophonically.
